# CMDline-Password-Spray
Password Spray attack within the commandline (.bat file)

The original .bat file was taken from Carrie Roberts @OrOneEqualsOne.
If you would like to see the original version, here is her link:

The file originally did not work for me and therefore I modified it.
My copy has worked for me on a recent engagement.
